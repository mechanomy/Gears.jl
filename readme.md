# Gears.jl
This package models Gears generally, including:
* functions for calculating involute tooth profiles
* working with gear parameters and handbook equations
* gear standards
* plotting and other geometric outputs

As these encompass a lot of terrain, the aim is not to be comprehensive but immediately useful, supporting quick prototyping of gears especially through 3D printing.

## Basic example


<!-- GearTransmissions.jl uses this package to model gear trains in various configurations. -->
